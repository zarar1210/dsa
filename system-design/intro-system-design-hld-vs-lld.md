## **System Design Introduction - LLD & HLD**

### _System Design_

1. System design is the process of planning, structuring, and defining the architecture of a software system so that it meets business requirements.
2. It acts as a bridge between requirements and implementation, focusing on both functional and non-functional requirements.

### **_System design can be divided into two complementary parts:_**

#### 1. _High-Level Design (HLD)_

- It lays out the overall architecture of the system — how major components communicate, what services and modules will exist, and how data flows among them.
- It gives a big-picture view of how different systems fit together.
- It is typically done by architects, stakeholders, and managers.

#### 2. _Low-Level Design (LLD)_

- It focuses on how each component works internally and how it is implemented.
- Once the HLD is completed by stakeholders, senior developers create the LLD.

### **_Steps for Getting Started with System Design_**

Below are the steps to follow while designing any application, system, or product:

- **Understand the requirements**: Gather and analyze business needs by consulting stakeholders, users, and documentation.
- **Define the system architecture**: Identify key system components and how they communicate (databases, APIs, services, etc.).
- **Choose the technology stack**: Select appropriate languages, tools, and frameworks based on the requirements.
- **Design the modules**: Break the system into modules, defining their responsibilities and data flow.
- **Plan for scalability**: Use scalable design patterns to handle growth.
- **Consider security and privacy**: Identify risks and implement measures such as authentication, data protection, and encryption.
- **Test and validate**: Write test cases to ensure the system meets business requirements.
